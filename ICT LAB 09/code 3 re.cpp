//Encryption can be very useful method for protecting sensitive data from intruders.Data is
//converted into meaningless form by the usage of a given key and it is converted back to original
//form by utilizing the key again when required.You need to design an encryption\decryption
//application.
//Example:
//Inputs:
//Text: hello world, Key : 3
//Outputs :
//	Encrypted text : khoor zruog, Decrypted text : hello world
//	Note :
//1. Use only character arrays.
//2. String Library functions are not allowed.
//3. Make separate functions for encryption and decryption and write down the main
//function as well to make the code interactive.
//Usage of temporary arrays is prohibited.Both encryption and decryption should be performed
